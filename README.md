# Expense Tracker (C Programming)  
A CLI-based Expense Tracker developed using C programming and data structures to record, manage, and analyze daily expenses efficiently. The project demonstrates practical use of linked lists and file handling for dynamic data storage and retrieval.  

✨ Features  
-Add new expense records  
-View all stored expenses  
-Delete expense records  
-Search expenses  
-Persistent storage using CSV file  
-Dynamic memory allocation using linked lists  
-Simple and user-friendly CLI interface  

⚙️ How It Works  
-Expense records are stored as nodes in a linked list.  
-Each node contains details like ID, date, amount, category, and description.  
-CRUD operations manipulate the linked list in memory.  
-File handling is used to save and retrieve data from a CSV file.  
-The program runs through a menu-driven command-line interface.  

🛠️ Technologies Used  
-C Programming Language  
-Linked List (Data Structure)  
-File Handling  
-CSV File Storage  
-Command Line Interface (CLI)  

🎯 Learning Objectives  
-Understand implementation of linked lists in C  
-Learn file handling techniques for persistent storage  
-Apply CRUD operations using data structures  
-Improve memory management and pointer handling  
-Develop a modular and structured C program
